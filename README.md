# Requirements

- A [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installation
# Installation
Installing Azora Nukr is simple, just follow these quick steps

- 1: Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), you need to install python due to the fact its the coding language our tool uses
- 2: Download the [raider](https://github.com/AzoraProject/Azora-Nukr/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from [here](https://github.com/AzoraProject/Azora-Nukr/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

- 3: Find the location its downloaded in, right click on it, and extract it.

- 4: After all of these are complete, run setup.bat which will download and install all of the required libraries for the software and then start the software


# How to use
After installing the raider, heres what you have to do!
( if you havent already installed it then folow the guide above )
### Step 1.
- 1. Getting discord tokens needed for the raider. In order to use Azora Nukr, you need discord tokens. There are 2 methods to get them.
  - 1. Buying tokens using money. If you do not want to manually create accounts, you can buy lots of tokens in online stores
  - 2. Getting the token of your alt account. I recommend watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnBnm_tZlyU) video to do so 
### Step 2. Adding tokens to your raider
- 1. Input a valid discord token(s) inside of the TOKENS.txt file. In order to add more than one, seperate each token with a new like this.
```
token1
token2
token3
```
### Step 3. Using the tool itself
- 1. Open setup.bat. Setup.bat is a windows batch script that will download all the required python libraries needed for the script
- 2. After the script loads, you should be prompted with a command line interface. First, join all your tokens into the server your attempting to raid. If your tokens are fully verified, you should be able to use the token joiner, elsewise, you will have to join them manually.
- 3. After all the tokens are inside the server, choose an option, input the details nesscary and watch the magic happen!

# Problems and solutions

### Setup.bat doesnt work!
- If setup.bat does not work, ensure that you have python installed

### None of the options work
- Make sure all your tokens are joined into the server
### Literally any other issue
- Make a ticket in our [discord server](discord.gg/RsuR3DWzj5
